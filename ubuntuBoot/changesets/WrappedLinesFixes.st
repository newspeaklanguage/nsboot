Normally, this is not a problem besides making the source look ugly. However, in thecase of SmartRefStream>>applyConversionMethodsTo:className:varMap: the timestamp also got linewrapped and cause a problem when merging."!!SmartRefStream methodsFor: 'import image segment' stamp: 'tk 11/26/2004 05:53'!applyConversionMethodsTo: objectIn className: className varMap: varMap	"Modify the object's instance vars to have the proper valuesfor its new shape.  Mostly, fill in defaut values of new inst vars.Can substitute an object of a different class.
