How to produce Squeak4.3.2-spur.image & changes

1. run getsqueak43.sh
	- this downloads 4.3
2. run build431Image.sh
	- this builds a 4.3 image with condensed changes called Squeak4.3.1
3. run buildspurtrunkvmmakerimage.sh
	- this downloads the latest Spur trunk image and creates a VMMaker image
	  from it called SpurVMMaker
4. run buildspur431.sh
	- this uses SpurVMMaker to convert Squeak4.3.1 to Squeak4.3.1-spur and
	  create patched versions of the relevant packages in ../smalltalk

or ./build.sh for short
